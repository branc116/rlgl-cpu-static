# rlgl static cpu

Implement rlgl such that you don't have to link with glfw, nor X11 nor dynamicaly load opengl.
Just render stuff to array and write it to png.

# Why

If you wanna render something, but you don't have a working opengl implementaion on your device.

To create gui regression tests...
